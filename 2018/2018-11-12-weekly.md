- console.table 
- console.count(name)
- console.time() and console.timeEnd() 
  - [ ] is there any boundary for it? i.e. must call both within same function
- console.group ... group your console logs ....

Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know

https://www.info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf 

> This chapter gives an introduction to all the main programming paradigms, their underlying concepts, and the relationships between them. We give a broad view to help programmers choose the right concepts they need to solve the problems at hand. We give a taxonomy of almost 30 useful programming paradigms and how they are related. Most of them differ only in one or a few concepts, but this can make a world of difference in programming.
