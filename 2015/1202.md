### Editors

#### Atom

I use atom for most **script** and **text** editing. It features coffee-script and the active eco system. But it terrifies users with its **poor performance** in loading and editing large files.

See also [Atom packages in Weekly 2015/11/11](https://github.com/dyweb/web-stuff/blob/master/weekly/2015/1111.md#开发者工具).

#### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a multi-platform code editor for [various languages](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview). (Same as Atom and Sublime.)

It supports [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/overview), though since not very long ago. As you can see, the download numbers in its [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/#VSCode) are low, compared to Atom's and Sublime's. The good news is, you can write your own extension instead of almost always finding someone else has done it for Atom or Sublime.

I am using vscode for most of my text related work it has little different with sublime and atom, and it does not have spell check. But it works well with C# and is light weight.
