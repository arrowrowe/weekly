 > 1. Restrict to simple control flow constructs.
 > 2. Give all loops a fixed upper-bound.
 > 3. Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.
 > 4. Limit functions to no more than 60 lines of text.
 > 5. Use minimally two assertions per function on average.
 > 6. Declare data objects at the smallest possible level of scope.
 > 7. Check the return value of non-void functions, and check the validity of function parameters.
 > 8. Limit the use of the preprocessor to file inclusion and simple macros.
 > 9. Limit the use of pointers. Use no more than two levels of dereferencing per expression.
 > 10. Compile with all warnings enabled, and use one or more source code analyzers.

 > This is my multi-month study plan for going from mobile developer (self-taught, no CS degree) to machine learning engineer.

 > My main goal was to find an approach to studying Machine Learning that is mainly hands-on and abstracts most of the math for the beginner. This approach is unconventional because it’s the top-down and results-first approach designed for software engineers.
